/*
* This pattern of movement is made with the Cat enemy in mind, but could be used by 
* other enemy types. 
* Movement pattern is on a timer. An enemy with this pattern will move in a clockwise
* square pattern.
* After every "moveTime" milliseconds, the enemy will move to the next square in the
* pattern determined by the "nextDirection" in "directions".
* "moveTime" is generated one time randomly at the beginning of movement execution,
* between 500 (inclusive) and 1000 (inclusive).
* This movement pattern uses the given EnemyViewModel's movement methods, which will
* handle wall collisions.
